Maestro creates an interactive music conducting environment.  Users define their own gestures to manipulate various qualities of sound.  These include volume, key, tempo, specific areas of sound.


-Includes OpenNI & FMOD libraries
-Uses SensorKinect library to communicate with Kinect Sensor

Instructions:	
-To run Maestro

	cd Maestro/Development/Bin/Release
	./Maestro

-In order to use Maestro once running:
	
	Press 'r' to enter record mode, then press one of the following to 	select which gesture to record.  

	1 - Increase Volume
	2 - Decrease Volume
	3 - Increase Tempo
	4 - Decrease Tempo
	5 - Increase Pitch
	6 - Decrease Pitch
	f - lowpass
	g - highpass
	h - echo
	j - flange
	l - distortion
	k - chorus
	c - parameq
	q - Quit

	Once you have performed the gesture once, and you haven't hit the maximum number of states, press 'r' to complete.

	Press 'a' to record the gesture again, for algorithm purposes.

	Once you have recorded the gesture, repeat the procedure above to record other gestures.

	You can save your gestures by pressing 'S'.  You can load the gestures in the futures uses by pressing 'L'.

	To enter the Detecting Mode press 'd'.

	Here you can start the audio files by raising you right hand up above your head.  If your orientation is shifted to a side only 1 audio file will start.  If you are facing the middle then both audio files will play.

	To change the audio drop the audio files into:

	Maestro/Development/Config	

	Update the lines in GroupA.cpp & GroupB.cpp, located in Maestro/Development/Audio:

	result = system->createSound("../Config/NAME OF SONG", FMOD_SOFTWARE | FMOD_LOOP_NORMAL | FMOD_2D, 0, &sound[0]);

	NITE
	Sensor Kinect

	These are located in Include, installation may be necessary.
	
Maestro is only testes work on Mac OS X 10.6.  It will probably work on 10.5, but I am not certain about 10.7
